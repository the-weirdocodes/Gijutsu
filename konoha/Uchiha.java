// Let's start with the basic structure of java program, there are four parts, project->package->class->method. (Project name may not be visible)
// Let's understand it hierarchically, Konoha (Hidden Leaf village) has different clans, each clan has members, each member has Kekkei Genkai. 
// Similarly, Imagine Project as Fire nation, package as Konoha, Class as Uchiha Clan, Method as Uchiha Sasuke.
// Let's put it simple, 
//Project->Package->Class->Method
//Fire Nation->Hidden Leaf Village->Uchiha->Uchiha Sasuke.
//There's no fire nation without hidden villages like Konoha, there's no Konoha without it's clans, there's no clan with members in it.
//Likewise, Project, Package, Class, Method are always "interdependent" on each other.

//Let's see more about Classes and methods in the next session.
